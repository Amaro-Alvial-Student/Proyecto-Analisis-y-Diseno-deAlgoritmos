Hi, we are a team consisting of Amaro Alvial, Benjamin Chamorro, and Fernanda VÃ¡squez. 
This is a university project focused on procedural generation.

Specifically, we want to create an algorithm that will be capable of generating an exclusive weapon design for every player in an 
RPG game with pixel art graphics.
